Software is at the core of so many of the tools we use today: nearly everyone uses social networks to communicate, virtually all people have internet-connected phones in their purse or pocket, and most office jobs involve interacting with a computer to get work done. As a result, the demand for people who can code has skyrocketed. Countless books, online tutorials, and developer boot camps promise to turn ambitious beginners into software engineers with six-figure salaries.

This book is not for those people. It’s for everyone else.

On its own, this book won’t turn you into a professional software developer any more than a few guitar lessons will turn you into a rock star. But if you’re an office worker, administrator, academic, or anyone else who uses a computer for work or fun, you will learn the basics of programming so that you can automate simple tasks such as these:

- Moving and renaming thousands of files and sorting them into folders
- Filling out online forms—no typing required
- Downloading files or copying text from a website whenever it updates
- Having your computer text custom notifications to your phone
- Updating or formatting Excel spreadsheets
- Checking your email and sending out prewritten responses
- Creating databases and querying them for information
- Extracting text from images and audio files

These tasks are simple but time-consuming for humans, and they’re often so trivial(Important) or specific that there’s no ready-made software to perform them. Armed with a little bit of programming knowledge, however, you can have your computer do these tasks for you.
